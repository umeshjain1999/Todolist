### Motivation
I created this project when I started learning Javascript library called **Reactjs** to grasp the concept of react library.

### Technology 
- <b>Built with</b> -> [Reactjs](https://reactjs.org/)
- <b>Editor used</b> -> [vscode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) , [codesandbox](https://codesandbox.io/)
- <b>Hosting</b> -> [netlify](https://app.netlify.com/)

### Features
* Whenever any task is created it shows time of creation and when
it is marked done it updates the time accordingly.
* Multiple themes available.
* Used local storage of your browser to save todos every time you revisit your app.
* coming many more...

### How I created this project
- I have used useState and useEffect to manage the data across the components in Reactjs.
- Used JSON format data to manage todos.
- For multiple themes css variables were helpful. 

### Credits
