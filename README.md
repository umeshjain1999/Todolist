## Todo App
Todo is a task management app to help you stay organized and manage your day-to-day.

### Motivation
I created this project when I started learning Javascript library called **Reactjs** to grasp the concept of react library.

### Technology 
- <b>Built with</b> [Reactjs](https://reactjs.org/)
- <b>Editor used</b> [vscode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) , [codesandbox](https://codesandbox.io/)

### Features
* Shows time of creation and time updates as you checked the todo.
* Multiple themes available.
* Used localstorage to save todos every time you revisit your app.
* coming many more...

### How I created this project
- I have used the concept of hooks (useState,useEffect) from react to manage the todo across components.
- For multiple themes css variables were helpful. 

### Credits
Learned the concepts of reactjs from this channel [Codevolution](https://youtu.be/QFaFIcGhPoM).
