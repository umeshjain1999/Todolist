# Todo App
Todo is a task management app to help you stay organized and manage your day-to-day.
#### [hosted here](https://reactjs-todo-list-yo.netlify.app/)


## Motivation
I created this project when I started learning Javascript library called **Reactjs** to grasp the concept of react library.

## Technology 
- <b>Built with</b> -> [Reactjs](https://reactjs.org/)
- <b>Editor used</b> -> [vscode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) , [codesandbox](https://codesandbox.io/)
- <b>Hosting</b> -> [netlify](https://app.netlify.com/)

## Features
* Whenever any task is created it shows time of creation and when
it is marked done it updates the time accordingly.
* Multiple themes available.
* Save the mode of theme you were using last time.
* Used local storage of your browser to save todos every time you revisit your app.
* Different tabs for All, Completed, Active Tasks.
* Delete button to clear all task from the app.

## How I created this project
- I have used useState and useEffect to manage the data across the components in Reactjs.
- Used JSON format data to manage todos.
- For multiple themes css variables were helpful.
- Different tabs are created using [Router](https://reactrouter.com/web/guides/quick-start).
